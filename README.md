# FiveBitGrayMapperCpp

## Overview
`FiveBitGrayMapperCpp` is a C++ program that generates Gray code representations for all 5-bit binary numbers, displays them alongside their binary counterparts, and decodes the Gray code back to binary. It features a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) with color-coded output for enhanced readability.

## Features
- Generates Gray code for all 5-bit binary numbers.
- Displays binary, Gray code, and decoded binary values in a tabular format.
- Color-coded CLI output for distinct visualization of different data columns.
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions and error handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
